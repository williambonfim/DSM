# DSM - Direct-Stiffness-Method-Framed-Structures

This program uses the direct stiffness method to analyze and evaluate the structural behavior of framed structures. The program takes the inputs of the structure's geometry, material properties, and loading conditions and outputs the nodal displacements and element stresses/forces.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root folder of the project.

## Usage

1. Input the structure's geometry, material properties, and loading conditions in the input file.
2. Run the command `python main.py` in the root folder of the project to start the analysis.
3. The program will output the nodal displacements, element stresses/forces and all data information from the direct stiffness method in the terminal.

## Notes

- The program assumes that the user has basic understanding of the direct stiffness method, structural analysis and the theory of framed structures.
- The program uses the information provided by the user, it does not guarantee the accuracy of the results.
- The program is provided as-is and the developer(s) of this program will not be held responsible for any damages or losses that may occur as a result of using this program.
- Always verify the results by comparing them with other methods or experimental data.
